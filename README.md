## 👋 The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
<br>🔸 Beautiful is better than ugly.
<br>🔸 Explicit is better than implicit.
<br>🔸 Simple is better than complex.
<br>🔸 Complex is better than complicated.
<br>🔸 Flat is better than nested.
<br>🔸 Sparse is better than dense.
<br>🔸 Readability counts.
<br>🔸 Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
<br>🔸 Although practicality beats purity.
<br>🔸 Errors should never pass silently.
<br>🔸 Unless explicitly silenced.
<br>🔸 In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
<br>🔸 There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
<br>🔸 Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
<br>🔸 Now is better than never.
<br>🔸 Although never is often better than *right* now.
<br>🔸 If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
<br>🔸 If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
<br>🔸 Namespaces are one honking great idea 
<br>✨ let's do more of those!
